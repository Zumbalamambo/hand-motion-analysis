Run "prepareTrainingData.py" when you have new training data. New training data should be in "transport-controlled" folder.
Run "learnHandMotion.py" for classification of data which are not annotated.

"prepareTrainingData.py" reads data and annotation files from folder "transport-controlled" and writes a combined file of data and annotation to folder "data" 

"learnHandMotion.py" reads training data from "data" folder and testing data from "transport-controlled-notannotated" or "transport-uncontrolled" folders. It performs dimentionlity reduction using pca, uses svm to train and get classification of the data. It lso converts data to timeseries.

PCA and SVM are done using scikit-learn machine learning library.
